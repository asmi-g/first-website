# first-website

Hello! This is the code for my personal website, which is also my first website. It features a home page, portfolio page, about me page, as well as a contact page with a working contact form using (using FormSubmit), and uses HTML, CSS as well as JavaScript. As this was my first self-learnt and led software project, I hope to continue to learn more about web development and programming!
