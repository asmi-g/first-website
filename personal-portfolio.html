                <p class="intro-text">As a student who entered an engineering program without any significant technical experience,
                    <br> I've gotten the opportunity to contribute to a lot of team projects, as well as work on my
                    <br> programming skills through pursuing projects on my own personal time. Below are some of the projects
                    <br> I've worked on, thus far!</p>

                        <li>Contribution: As part of the university design team, UW Orbital, an aerospace engineering-centered student team, I worked on the firmware of the weather balloon project, which included designing the circuit for, and using SPI protocol to configure pictures from an Arducam OV5642 module and save to an SD card using an arduino.</li>

                        <li>Issue: The current NASA app is hard to navigate, and is overwhelming to look at. As my first UX/UI redesign, I first noted key features to include (such as news updates, images, videos), and some nice-to-haves. </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>I then researched popular social networking apps to take inspiration from, and planned the content layout of the new design. Finally, I prototyped it in Figma.</li>

                        <li>Through creating an unsolicited redesign, and prototyping an app wireframe using Figma, I have learned about concepts such as key design principles (creating a heirarchy of content to focus on, organizing features in apps), and used my own experience as an avid space enthusiast who saw room for improvement in NASA's current app interface.</li>

                        <li>Issue: As a post-secondary student, I saw a need for a productivity app that is well-rounded, versatile, and easy to navigate. To design this, I reflected upon my own study habits as a student, and listed features in an app that could help improve them.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>I then researched a color palette with a soothing ambience, as well as important resources to link in the app focused on mental health. Finally, I planned the content layout of the new design, and prototyped it in Figma.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Through creating an app design from scratch and prototyping in Figma, I have learned about the importance of keeping the user's needs as paramount when designing an app, while also using my own experience as the target demographic, in mind when considering features to include.</li>

I also programmed functions in C++ to read user input according to data collected by the color sensor, along with programming functions to record, and continually update the player-robot scoreboard.</li>

This was done through implementing design principles such as retaining the structure’s stability during the movement of the robot, along with keeping the structure as light as possible.</li>
